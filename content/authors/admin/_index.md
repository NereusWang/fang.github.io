  - title: High-density Flexible Tactile Sensor Array for Vital Sign Monitoring Utilizing Deep Learning Model
    date: '2023-11-25'
    awarder: Shanghai Inst of Microsystem & IT, Guangdong Province Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital
    summary: |
      We independently design wearable tactile sensor array which can collect human radial artery pulse signals (timing-series tactile surface data in humans) and conduct in-depth fusion research with the pulse in medicine through MEMS chip technology. Due to the tactile data are the differential pressure signals generated by Wheatstone Bridge, I can make in-depth research on tactile sensor and bio-sensor data processing using machine learning and interpretable deep learning algorithm models. I delineate the tactile signals of arteries with varying stiffness using a dense sensor array, and analyze the factors affecting human tactility of stiffness and softness at fingertip with a deep learning model. Furthermore, we report an innovative and non-invasive method of arterial stiffness measurement and work accepted by IEEE MEMS 2023, which is the international top level conference in the field of sensor.
